# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis


## Project overview

This project analyzes the cost and profitability of food delivery operations using Python. 
It explores operational expenses, revenue breakdowns, and profitability metrics to identify efficiency improvements.


### Key Technical Topics:

- 1 - Data Loading and Preparation: 

  Order datasets contain details on delivery costs, charges, and order types.
  
  Pandas is used for data cleaning, including handling missing values and data formatting.
- 2 - Cost Analysis:

  Breakdown of costs, focusing on fixed (e.g., service fees) and variable (e.g., distance-related) expenses.

  Calculation of per-order costs to find primary cost drivers.
- 3 - Profitability Calculation:

  Determination of per-order profit margins by comparing costs and revenue.
- 4 - Data Visualization: 

  Matplotlib is used for creating visualizations:

  -Distribution of costs and profits.

  -Profitability trends by factors like order type or delivery distance
- 5 -Business Insights : 

     Insights on the most profitable orders and potential cost-saving areas for delivery operations.


### Key Takeaways:

- Total Orders: 1,000 

- Total Revenue: 126,990 INR 

- Total Costs: 68,502 INR 

- Total Profit: 58,488 INR 

Profit Distribution:
Visualized the profit distribution per order using a histogram. Identified the mean profit per order. 

Cost Breakdown:
- Delivery Fee: 40.8% 

- Payment Processing Fee: 37.4% 
- Discount Amount: 21.8%
- Recommended commission percentage: 30% 
- Recommended discount percentage: 6% 
- Simulated profitability showed a potential increase in profit density with recommended rates.
